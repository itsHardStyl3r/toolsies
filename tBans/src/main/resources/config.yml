# Clean up task clears expired punishments.
# The task is running asynchronously. It calls deleteIfExpired with null sender.

# Currently disabled but the implementation should be ready though.

# Minimum duration of temporary punishments.
# Value 0 corresponds to minimum duration of 5 seconds.
#
# It is highly unrecommended to set values less than 5 seconds.
# There's no particular reason, it just doesn't make sense.

  ban: 15s
  warn: 5m
