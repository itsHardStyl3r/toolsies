# Priority-aware punishments require tPerms (!)
#
# This section determines whether priorities should matter
# when it comes to punishments.
# If enabled, a player (or an admin) with lower or equal group priority
# can't make a certain punishment to some other player with higher one.
# E.g.
#  moderator (4) can't ban other moderator (4)
#  moderator (4) can be banned by admin (5)
#  admin (5) can't be banned by moderator (4)
# The priorities are bypassed by operators, console and players that have
# toolsies.<ban/kick/warn/mute>.bypasspriority permission.
