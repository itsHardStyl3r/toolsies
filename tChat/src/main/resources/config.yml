  # backAndForthConversation: when enabled, both sender and recipient
  # are chained together, so that /reply will work just after one of the
  # players texts the other. This is old messaging functionality and
  # the default for most plugins. This could potentially make someone "steal"
  # a reply, so this is disabled here.
  # When disabled, each player has to send a message to one another using /msg
  # before they will be chained.

  # This option determines whether full (true) or beginning of (false) a nickname should be considered a mention.
  # e.g. @HardStyl3r is a "full name" mention, whereas @hard, @hards, or @hardstyl are "beginning of" mentions.
  usePlayerExact: false
  # An option to allow @everyone mentions, which mentions every player online.
  # Permission `toolsies.chat.mention.everyone` would still be required.
  allowEveryoneMention: true
  # Define how the mentioned user should be notified.
  # Note that volume should be between 0 and 1 and pitch between 0 and 2.
