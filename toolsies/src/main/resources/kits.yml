# The items section uses Material (item ids) to
# populate the kit. If you need to add two or more
# items (Materials), add some number after the dash.
# The number won't matter.
#
# In order to receive the kit, sender needs `toolsies.kit.<kit>`.
#
# The kits can be gifted if sender can receive a kit on their own
# and has permissions
# `toolsies.kits.others` and `toolsies.kits.others.<kit>`.
# The target needs to have permissions allowing them to
# receive the kit.
